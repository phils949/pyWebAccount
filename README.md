pyWebAccount
============

Python Flask-based sample application that provides user identity and user authentication features.

Overview
--------

Uses a Python Flask based web server to serve both a REST API and a web 
front-end that uses JQuery/AJAX to present a set of basic features that 
most web sites use for user account creation, login, forgot password, verify 
email address, lock account, change password, edit account profile.

The objective is to provide an example application skeleton, REST API example, 
web application example, and a useful starting point for any web application 
that fits with this application architecture.
